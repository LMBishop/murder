# murder (s&box)

A re-creation of Murder from Garry's Mod, in s&box. Available at [asset.party](https://asset.party/leonardobishop/murder).

## Progress

This project is in active development. Things are broken, features are missing, and the code can be described as a "bodge" at best.

It currently uses assets from the base game, [Sandbox](https://github.com/Facepunch/sandbox), and [simple weapon base](https://github.com/timmybo5/simple-weapon-base).

To-do:

- Murderer's ability to see footsteps.
- Murderer's ability to throw knife.
- Most sound effects.
- Most weapon effects (though they do work).
- Spectator mode.
- The whole clue system thing that nobody really cared about.
- De-shittify code.

Already implemted:

- Most of the actual Murder logic.
- Basic movement / networking / etc.
- Weapon functionality (sans knife throwing).
- Blinding.
- Inventory "system".

## Feedback
